<h1>
   FlatSix Modular Firmaware Uploader 
  </h1>
	<p>This is a firmware uploaded for arduino-based modules such as Slight Of Hand. It only works in Chrome on a Mac or PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Make sure to unplug your module from the eurorack power cable first!</li>
	  <li>Plug in your USB cable to the mini usb port on the Slight Of Hand</li>
	  <li>The chip next to the USB port will have an "O" or an "N" on it - Click the matching button</li>
	  <li>If you don't have an N or O on the chip, try "O" first, then "N". Guessing won't hurt anything.</li> 				
	  <li>Select the USB serial option from the prompt that pops up.</li>
	  <li>Wait until the uploaded finishes</li>
	  <li>You're done. Unplug from the USB cable, plug in the power, and go make some music.</li>
	</ol>
